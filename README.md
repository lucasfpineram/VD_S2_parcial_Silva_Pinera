In this project i focused on data regarding rat extermination requests in the city of Buenos Aires. Through JavaScript i made graphics to show 
where there are more requests, requests that were closed in the top three neighborhoods with the highest number, and finally, 
of the top three neighborhoods with the most requests, which ones were resolved more quickly.
